/**
 * Verifies the discovery/wiring half of the cli split (the companion publishing half is covered by
 * {@link CliCompanionPublishingSpec}): auto-provisioning of the cli tier onto {@code grailsCli},
 * the guarantee that the tier is compile-visible but never leaks onto the runtime classpath, and
 * the {@code cliAutoProvision} opt-out.
 *
 * <p>The critical scenario is a companion advertised by a command-bearing plugin developed in the
 * <em>same build</em> as the consuming app. That companion must be wired as a project dependency
 * requesting the plugin's {@code cli} feature capability — not as an unversioned external module
 * coordinate, which would send Gradle to a repository for a jar the sibling project has not
 * published.</p>
