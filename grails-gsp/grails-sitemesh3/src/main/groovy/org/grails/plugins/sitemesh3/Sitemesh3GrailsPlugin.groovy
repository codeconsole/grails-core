/**
 * Provides GSP layout decoration through SiteMesh 3's filter-less,
 * view-resolver-based integration. Installing it alongside the legacy
 * SiteMesh 2 module (grails-layout) is supported; in that case the
 * SiteMesh 2 integration keeps decorating and this one stands down.
 *
 * <p>The heavy lifting lives outside this class: default configuration
 * properties are contributed by {@link Sitemesh3EnvironmentPostProcessor}
 * (registered in {@code META-INF/spring.factories}) and the view-resolver
 * decoration is applied by {@link Sitemesh3AutoConfiguration}. The only bean
 * this plugin itself contributes is registered through {@link #beanRegistrar()},
 * the modern replacement for the deprecated {@code doWithSpring()} bean DSL.</p>
 *
 * <p>With no {@code doWithSpring()} bean-builder closure — whose dynamic
 * dispatch against the bean builder prevents static compilation of descriptor
 * classes — this plugin compiles statically as a whole.</p>
