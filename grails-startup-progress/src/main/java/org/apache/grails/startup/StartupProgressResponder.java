/**
 * Decides how the startup progress answers a request, and answers it, for both of the servers that answer
 * for it: the one that holds the application's port until the web server starts, and the filter inside the
 * application once the web server has the port. Each hands its requests over as an {@link Exchange}.
 *
 * <p>The two differ only in which requests they take. The server that holds the port before the web server
 * starts takes every request, since nothing else could answer one. The filter takes the startup progress's
 * own paths and, while the application starts and the progress page is served, browser page loads; every
 * other request, such as an API call or a request the application makes to itself from {@code BootStrap},
 * reaches the application as it always has.</p>
 *
 * <p>A request taken is answered the same way by either:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>at the status path, with the status the progress page polls for, or once the application is ready,
 *     with only that it is ready</li>
 *     <li>at the report path, with the report as data to a client asking for JSON, and once the application is
 *     ready, with the report page</li>
 *     <li>when it carries the token from the log, by signing the browser in and sending it on to the address
 *     without the token</li>
 *     <li>otherwise, while the application starts, with the progress page for a browser and a plain
 *     {@code 503} for anything else</li>
 * </ul>
