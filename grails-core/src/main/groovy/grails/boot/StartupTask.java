/**
 * Reports the progress of a piece of work an application or plugin does while the application starts,
 * such as running database migrations or loading reference data, so that whatever follows the start can
 * show how far it has got: the startup progress page and report, or the {@code startup} endpoint of
 * Spring Boot Actuator.
 *
 * <p>A task has a description and, when it is known, the number of items of work it will do. Each item
 * is begun with a name and ended when it is done:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * try (StartupTask task = StartupTask.start(applicationContext, 'Loading reference data', files.size())) {
 *     for (File file in files) {
 *         task.startItem(file.name)
 *         load(file)
 *         task.endItem()
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The task and its items are recorded as steps of the context's {@link ApplicationStartup}, named
 * {@value #TASK_STEP} and {@value #ITEM_STEP}, so a task costs nothing when nothing records the start.
 * Work done only to report a task, such as counting its items, can be skipped then, which
 * {@link #isRecorded(ApplicationContext)} tells. A task is reported from the thread that does its work.</p>
